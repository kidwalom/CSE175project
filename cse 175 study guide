	understand when nodeas are confditonally dependet and when the y are independent of eachohter
	+IF SOMETHING IS TOUCHING THE OTHER THING THE ARE RELATED: look up MARKOV BLANKET
machien learning 
	-unductive leanrtni problem with 10 binary inputs
	+PECERPTRON CANNOT LEARN A XOR STATEMENT BECAUSE :IT IS NOT LINERALY SEPEREABLE (perceptron can learn thing s fast and easily generalize it )
